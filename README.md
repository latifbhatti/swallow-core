=======================

Start by setting up the working enviroment

### Dependencies

#### JDK 8 or newer

We recommend LTS releases Java 8 and Java 11. You can install the JDK as recommended by your operating system, or use the prebuilt binaries from [AdoptOpenJDK](https://adoptopenjdk.net/).

#### SBT 

SBT is the most common built tool in the Scala community. You can download it [here](https://www.scala-sbt.org/download.html).  


### How to get started

Fork this repository on your own individual profiles. After forking clone the repository and run:

```sh
sbt test
```

You should see a whole bunch of output that ends with something like the following lines
```
[info] Tests: succeeded 1, failed 0, canceled 0, ignored 0, pending 0
[info] All tests passed.
[success] Total time: 5 s, completed Dec 16, 2020 12:18:44 PM
```
If you see the above then...

### It worked!

You are ready to go. Next step is to go inside the `docs/` folder where you will find the labs to perform.

<<<<<<< HEAD
* Use packages and following conventions for [structure](https://www.scala-sbt.org/1.x/docs/Directories.html) and [naming](http://docs.scala-lang.org/style/naming-conventions.html)
* Package names should be clearly reflected in the testing hierarchy
* Build tests for all your work
* Read more about testing in SBT in the [SBT docs](https://www.scala-sbt.org/1.x/docs/Testing.html)
* This template includes a [test dependency](https://www.scala-sbt.org/1.x/docs/Library-Dependencies.html#Per-configuration+dependencies) on [chiseltest](https://github.com/ucb-bar/chisel-testers2), this is a reasonable starting point for most tests
  * You can remove this dependency in the build.sbt file if you want to
* Change the name of your project in the build.sbt file
* Change your README.md
